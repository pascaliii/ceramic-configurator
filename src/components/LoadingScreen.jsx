            This project is part of my master thesis in{' '}
            <strong>Digital Reality</strong> at{' '}
            <strong>University of Applied Sciences Hamburg </strong>. <br /> I
            used my technological knowledge to optimize the process of my hobby,
            which is pottery. This configurator helps me to decide which glazes
            would word with different shapes. I created PBR materials that are
            as close as possible to the common ceramic glazes from Botz and
            other Glaze companies.
            <br />
            <br />I hope this configurator is not only used by me, but also by
            other potters. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Disclaimer</strong> <br /> Even though i tried my best to
            create realistic materials/glazes, the look of your final product
            may look different depending on the fire temperature and clay type.
            For now the materials represent glazes burned by 1250Â°C. <br />
            <br /> Have fun and try it out!

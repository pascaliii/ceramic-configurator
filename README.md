# Ceramic Configurator

This Ceramic Configurator is the technical part of my master thesis. 
It is created with React, Three.js, React-Three-Fiber, React-Three-Drei & Vite.

The glazes where made with Adobe 3D Sampler from pictures of the real glazes of the glaze companies Botz and Carl JÃ¤ger. 

The 3D Models where created in Blender. Due to some issues with ReactThreeFiber (https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/discussions/3002#discussion-5608250) the glazes where applied inside Blender aswell and just switched in React. 

Checkout the project on my website: [config.pascaleschmidtceramics.de](https://config.pascaleschmidtceramics.de/)
